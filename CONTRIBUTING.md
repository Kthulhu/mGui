mGui is open source for a reason. If you'd like to contribute, we'd like to have you! 


# Documentation and examples
If you're interested in contributing but don't feel ready to make big changes to the code, helping us to improve and expand our [documentation](https://github.com/theodox/mGui/wiki) and [examples](https://github.com/theodox/mGui/tree/master/mGui/examples) is an excellent way to get involved.  For examples, just submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/).  If you want to add a tutorial or work on the wiki, contact @theodox (or just open an issue to put your suggestion in front of other users) and we'll add you to the project so you can edit the wiki.

# bug fixes and code cleanup

If you've spotted a bug or an oversight (say, a control is missing a new flag or has a typo), the best idea is to open an issue on the [issues page](https://github.com/theodox/mGui/issues) first so that other users can verify the issue or help localise it to a particular combination of OS and Maya version.  Submit a pull request referencing the issue.

# new features

So far we've generally evolved new features informally. Typically we'll open an issue to discuss the idea, then create a new branch for the feature and submit a pull from the branch as it matures.  It's a good idea to start with an issue before diving in on development so you can hear from other users who may have tried something similar in the past.
